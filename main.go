/*
	package <name>

package is a collection of common source code files

- Executable package: package main is an executable package which would produce an executable file (for main.go)
on being compiled and hence, it should contain a function named main which is the entry point of the project

- Reusable package: other (non-executable) helper packages can have any name other than main
*/
package main

/*
	- Single package import:
		import "<package name>"

	- Multiple packages import:
		import (
			"<package name>"
			"<package name>"
			"<package name>"
			...
		)
import provides access to all functionalities of a package to the current working package

fmt: is a standard go library which is used to format printing data
Go Standard Libraries are listed [here]: https://pkg.go.dev/std

other reusable packages can be imported in same way

		-	This way of variable declaration can be used outside a function's body too
		-	Also, variable can be declared and initialized with a value later

			 	var <variable name> <variable type>
				<variable name> = <variable value>

			NOT outside as it is considered a non-declaration statement. Using it outside a function's body
			will produce error.
